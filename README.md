# ML-Assignment

The assignment is to create a recommender system based on collaborative filtering using Matrix Factorization. 

We created 2 different versions of recommender systems. One is with Matrix factorization and another with cosine similarity. 
We also developed a Flask application to display the recommendations based on a selection in the drop down menu.

Reproducing prediction results:

Run the file movie_ml.py, open a web browser and type in "http://localhost:8000". This opens the flask webpage. Click on the prediction tab and select your favorite movie. Clicking on Recommend me! would get the recommended movies!
Dataset used : MovieLens 100k-ml
We also included a video clip of the recommendation page.
